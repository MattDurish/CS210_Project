# CS210_Project
This project scenario for the course was to develop an OOP application regarding interest calculations and to practice the best standards for comments and naming.

An interactive system has to be made to teach high school students the concepts of fiscal responsibility. The application is to help users be able to see how their investments will grow over time every year for the number of years the user inputs. 

I think that this program does a particularly good job at demonstrating the separation of functions as well as reducing code repetiton. This program however could use improvements in the try/catch error handles to be more efficient and reduce program size. Completing the calculation functions in the class function .cpp file would also help in reducing potential errors in accessing object data.

The most challenging portion of this program was the two for loops to calculate and build the interest for how the user needs the information. Floats tend to be tricky with rounding and that was my largest problem with troubleshooting, but it was overcame by checking how certain calculations were made with other data types. \

I intend to transfer the skills of using functions to reduce the size of the main function, such as will print functions that are used multiple times in loops. Also having debug steps that check the data values at every added step will be essential to minimizing debug time. 

I focused on separating certain processes into functions as well as spacing certain regions based on their overall purpose. Comments were aimed to be above the sequence to be described, and futher details are placed after the expected line. All variables and naming was designed to describe it's purpose. Any users wishing to understand and/or modify the program will hopefully be able to see the purpose of each given line.
